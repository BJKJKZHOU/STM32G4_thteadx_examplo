# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language focusing on motor control functionality]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level with emphasis on safety and timing requirements]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value] with timing and safety validation"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [motor control action], **Then** [expected motor response within timing constraints]
2. **Given** [normal operation], **When** [safety condition triggered], **Then** [system fails safely without hardware damage]

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level with emphasis on safety and timing requirements]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently with safety validation]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [motor control action], **Then** [expected outcome with timing compliance]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level with emphasis on safety and timing requirements]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently with resource constraint validation]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [motor control action], **Then** [expected outcome respecting hardware constraints]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [overcurrent condition]?
- How does system handle [overtemperature condition]?
- What is the response during [voltage supply fluctuation]?
- How does the system behave during [encoder/feedback failure]?
- What happens when [timing constraints are violated]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
  ALL REQUIREMENTS MUST COMPLY WITH THE PROJECT CONSTITUTION REGARDING TIMING, SAFETY, AND HARDWARE CONSTRAINTS
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST execute FOC control algorithm within specified timing constraints (e.g., control loop <100μs)
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement comprehensive error handling and fault detection mechanisms
- **FR-003**: System MUST fail safely in response to hardware faults or timing violations
- **FR-004**: System MUST operate within specified hardware constraints (memory, processing power)
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide motor control protection (overcurrent, overtemperature, overvoltage)

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: Control loop timing requirement is [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific timing constraint not specified]
- **FR-007**: Safety-critical validation approach [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific testing methodology not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Motor Control Parameters]**: [Motor-specific parameters like pole pairs, inductance, resistance, without implementation details]
- **[Safety State]**: [Current safety status including fault conditions, protective actions taken]
- **[Timing Constraints]**: [Specific timing requirements for control loops, sampling, and response times]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
  ADD TIMING, SAFETY, AND RESOURCE USAGE MEASUREMENTS
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Control loop executes within specified timing constraints (e.g., <100μs at 10kHz)
- **SC-002**: System detects and responds to fault conditions within safety timing requirements
- **SC-003**: Memory usage stays below 80% of available resources on STM32G474xx
- **SC-004**: Motor operates safely under all specified operating conditions without hardware damage
- **SC-005**: All safety mechanisms pass validation and verification testing
