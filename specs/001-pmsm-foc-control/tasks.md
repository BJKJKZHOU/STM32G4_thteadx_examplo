# Tasks: PMSM FOC Control System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-pmsm-foc-control/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **STM32 Project**: `Core/Src/`, `Core/Inc/`, `Drivers/`, `Middlewares/`, `tests/` at repository root
- All code must comply with STM32 HAL/LL driver best practices
- Paths shown below follow STM32 project structure based on plan.md

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - PMSM FOC Basic Control (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Safety-critical components before functional components
- Timing-critical functions before integration
- Core implementation before integration
- All safety validations complete before story completion
- All timing validations complete before story completion
- All hardware constraint validations complete before story completion
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Functions within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):
Task: "Unit test for basic motor control functions in tests/unit/test_motor_control.c (verifies timing constraints)"
Task: "Safety validation test for overcurrent protection in tests/safety/test_fault_protection.c"

# Launch all functions for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Implement basic motor control interface in Core/Src/motor_control.c (with timing validation)"
Task: "Create safety mechanism for basic protection in Core/Src/safety.c (with fault detection)"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories, defines all constraints)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently with timing and safety validation
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready with all constraints defined
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently with timing/safety validation ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently with timing/safety validation ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently with timing/safety validation ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories or violating constraints

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (especially constraint definitions)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently, all with compliance verification

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently with timing and safety compliance
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- CRITICAL: All timing-critical code must be validated against timing constraints
- CRITICAL: All safety-critical code must be validated with safety tests
- CRITICAL: All hardware resources must be validated against constraints
- CRITICAL: Before completion, each story must be verified to not violate any constitution principles
