## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - PMSM FOC Basic Control (Priority: P1)

An engineer controls a PMSM motor using the FOC system, starting and stopping the motor, setting speed parameters, and monitoring basic status in real-time. The system provides basic protection against overcurrent, overvoltage, and overtemperature.

**Why this priority**: This is the most critical functionality as it establishes the core motor control capability that all other features depend on. Without basic start/stop and speed control, the system has no value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by connecting a PMSM motor, issuing start/stop commands and speed setpoints, and verifying the motor responds appropriately with safety protection mechanisms working within timing constraints.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** motor is stopped and system is ready, **When** user sends start command with speed setpoint, **Then** motor starts and reaches requested speed within timing constraints
2. **Given** motor is in normal operation, **When** overcurrent condition is detected, **Then** system fails safely by stopping motor and protecting hardware
3. **Given** motor is running at requested speed, **When** user sends stop command, **Then** motor stops safely within expected time
4. **Given** motor is running, **When** user changes speed setpoint, **Then** motor reaches new speed smoothly within 500ms

### User Story 2 - Advanced Position and Current Control (Priority: P2)

An engineer configures and uses position and current control in addition to speed control for more precise motor operation. The system implements full FOC algorithm for optimal current control.

**Why this priority**: This adds precision control capabilities that are essential for many motor control applications, building on the core functionality in User Story 1.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring position control mode, setting position targets, and verifying the motor accurately reaches those positions while maintaining proper current control and safety protection.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** motor is stopped, **When** user sets position control mode and target position, **Then** motor moves to target position with precision within 1 degree
2. **Given** motor is in current control mode, **When** FOC algorithm is active, **Then** d/q axis currents are controlled within ±2% of target values
3. **Given** motor is operating under position control, **When** position error exceeds safety threshold, **Then** system transitions to safe state

---

### User Story 3 - Communication and Monitoring (Priority: P3)

A system operator monitors motor status remotely via CAN or serial communication and sends speed commands from a host computer. The system continuously reports motor state (current, speed, position) to the host.

**Why this priority**: This provides the interface for real-world applications where remote monitoring and control is needed, but is less critical than core motor control functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by connecting host computer via CAN or serial, sending commands, and verifying bidirectional communication with real-time status updates while maintaining core motor control and safety functions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** host computer is connected via CAN, **When** host sends speed command, **Then** motor responds to command and reports status back to host
2. **Given** host is receiving status updates, **When** motor state changes, **Then** updated current, speed, and position data is sent to host within 100ms
3. **Given** communication link is active, **When** communication failure occurs, **Then** system maintains safe operation independent of host

### Edge Cases

- What happens when encoder feedback fails or is disconnected?
- How does system handle sudden load changes or motor stall conditions?
- What is the response during power supply fluctuations?
- How does the system behave during temperature extremes?
- What happens when communication timeout occurs during command execution?
